# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple web application scheduler that utilizes local storage to store events/plans for any busy individual.

## Installation
After creating a repository called work-day-scheduler in GitHub, VS code was used to create files such as index.html, script.js, and styles.css. Then I copied the starter code into the index.html and styles.css files. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


## Usage
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is triggered, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.
